My name is Umut. I am not someone who joins the majority, I usually come up with an idea by thinking with my own logic and doing a lot of research. I'm curly and of medium height. I am interested in jobs such as forum management and writing, and my hobbies include the field of electronic technology. I love anime and meaningful cartoons, but I rarely watch them, and when I watch them, I watch them for very long periods of time. I don't have addictions that common people have, such as television or cigarettes. Silence, calmness, claustrophobia, acousticophobia, agoraphobia, atelophobia, etc. I have phobias. I love listening to music, drawing, solving problems, doing work, and watching anime. I am a cold person, but I can turn into a good person after introducing with you.
